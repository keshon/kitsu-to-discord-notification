# Bot can quote comments for updated status if there are any - you can truncate them via `comment_truncate_at`
# Silent update set to true is useful for the first run. Otherwise Bot would spam chat with a lot of statuses on exisitng Kitsu instance.
# `Admin chat ID` is a numerical ID of Telegram chats. On first run type `/lookup` command privatly to bot - it will print an array ..
# .. with `chat_id` field contatining the ID. Put it to `admin_chat_id` - you are now the admin.
